# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-Indian-Crude-Oil-Prices

## Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian crude oil prices is a comprehensive study that delves into the trends and patterns observed in the data obtained from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). The dataset spans from the year 2000 to 2020, encompassing a significant period of time that allows for a thorough analysis of the crude oil price dynamics in India.

## Key Features

### 1. Basic Statistics and Distribution

- Examination of the basic statistics and distribution of crude oil prices over the years.
- Utilization of matplotlib.pyplot to create line plots, histograms, and box plots for visualizing price trends and identifying outliers or seasonality.

### 2. Interactive Visualizations

- Use of plotly.express to generate interactive visualizations for in-depth exploration of price movements over time.

### 3. Impact Analysis of Significant Events

- Segmentation of data into two periods: before and after the onset of significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Comparative analysis using line plots and bar graphs to understand drastic price fluctuations and demand-supply imbalances during critical periods.

### 4. Correlation with Economic Indicators

- Investigation of the correlation between crude oil prices and economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and international oil prices.
- Insights into the interdependencies between various factors influencing fluctuations in Indian crude oil prices.
